## Kafka Integration
The API is integrated with Kafka for event-based processing. Kafka topics are used for handling order-related events, ensuring seamless communication and processing between different parts of the system.

## Redis Caching
Redis is used as a distributed cache to improve performance and reduce latency. Cached data includes frequently accessed customer and product information, enhancing the overall responsiveness of the API.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using the API, refer to the troubleshooting section in the wiki for common problems and solutions.
